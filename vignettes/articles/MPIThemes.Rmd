The pdf RMarkdown templates compile with XeLatex. You will need to install some version of XeLatex. If you do not have one, there is a simple way in R. [Tinytex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) is A lightweight LaTeX distribution that is sufficient for compiling pdf templates. To install the tinytex package and a working version of LaTeX run these commands:

``` r
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

The MPITheme package requires additional LaTeX dependencies that tinytex does not install by default. If you are online, these dependencies will be installed automatically.
