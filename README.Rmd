The goal of the MPIThemes package is to provide a variety of Rmarkdown templates with ggplot themes for scientific reproducible research with custom design for the MAX PLANCK institute.

Rmarkdown templates can be rendered in PDF, Docx, and HTML format. Especially you can create PDF reports without worrying about the lateX code. Included in the package are:

- Beamer presentation
- Analytical reports

The pdf RMarkdown templates compile with XeLatex. You will need to install some version of XeLatex. If you do not have one, there is a simple way in R. [Tinytex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) is A lightweight LaTeX distribution that is sufficient for compiling pdf templates.
To install the tinytex package and a working version of LaTeX 
run these commands:

``` r
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

The MPITheme package requires additional LaTeX dependencies that tinytex does not install by default. If you are online, these dependencies will be installed automatically.

## Installation

You can install the released version of MPIThemes from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Ehyaei/MPIThemes")
```
